# Flexible Swiss
Flexible Swiss is a bracket style very similar to Swiss, but one that allows for more flexibility in the order in which maps are played. This specific implementation is a web app version of this bracket. Players are automatically matched up with players at the same level and the bracket runs until everybody has a different rank, or is cut off.

## Getting Started
